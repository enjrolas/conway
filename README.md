this game of life simulator was written for a pair programming exercise at recurse.
It's written for processing 4 (download yours at processing.org)

___There are a bunch of keyboard commands that do stuff___
* 'space' toggles whether or not the program is running or paused
* 's' will advance the program only one step at a time
* 'd' will toggle debug mode, which will list the neighbors on the cell under the mouse
* clicking, particularly in pause mode, will toggle a given cell

try pressing space to pause, then clicking an interesting pattern, and then pressing space to let 'er rip and see what it does
